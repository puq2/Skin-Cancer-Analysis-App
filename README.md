# Skin-Cancer-Analysis-App

I have created an artificial intelligence app that can make predictions based on the photo you have taken. It was programmed to predict:

 * actinic keratosis
 * basal cell carcinoma
 * dermatofibroma
 * melanoma
 * nevus
 * pigmented benign keratosis
 * seborrheic keratosis
 * squamous cell carcinoma
 * vascular lesion

The TensorFlow neural network in this app was trained using images of skin cancer from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
